## API Integration

- **TMDB API**: The app fetches a list of trending movies from the TMDB API.
   - API endpoint:
     ``` 
     https://api.themoviedb.org/3/trending/movie/week
     ```
   - Fetch movie images from the following base URL:
     ```
     https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/
     ```

## Project Structure

Below is the architecture and data flow of the app, from data fetching to UI rendering:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. [Register on TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and generate an API key.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shivamkumard107/tmdb-compose.git
```

3. Open the project in Android Studio.
4. Put your API_KEY in the **local.properties** like API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>

### Running the App

To run the app, simply press **Run** in Android Studio after syncing the project dependencies. The app should now fetch the trending movies and display them.

### Movie Details Screen
When a user clicks on a movie, a detail screen is shown, displaying more information about the movie, such as the description, release date, and an image.

### Loading and Error States

- **Loading Indicators**: While the data is being fetched from the API, a loading spinner is displayed.
- **Error Handling**: If there is a network error or other issues, an error message is shown to the user.

## Code Quality & Best Practices

- **Clean Architecture**: The app follows clean architecture principles, separating concerns into distinct layers (data, domain, UI).
- **MVVM Pattern**: Uses the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to separate business logic from UI logic.
- **Kotlin Coroutines**: The app makes use of Kotlin coroutines for asynchronous data fetching.
